This is a demo React Native app showcasing an integration with the **[Offline Video SDK](https://www.thewidlarzgroup.com/offline-video-sdk?utm_source=github&utm_medium=sample-offline-app-readme&utm_id=hero-offline)**. It allows users to download video streams (e.g. HLS) and play them offline - even in airplane mode ✈️
No need to manually manage caching, DRM, or playback logic - the SDK handles it all for you.

## Features

* Video list with downloadable content
* Download icon on each item triggers local download
* Automatic playback from local storage if the asset is available
* Fallback to online streaming when the video hasn’t been downloaded yet
* Real-time download progress indicator

This sample app uses the SDK’s core capabilities – a lightweight and clean base for further development 🔧

## API Token Required

To run the app, you’ll need your own **SDK API token**, which can be generated by signing in to the dashboard: <br/>
👉 [https://www.thewidlarzgroup.com/offline-video-sdk](https://www.thewidlarzgroup.com/offline-video-sdk?utm_source=github&utm_medium=sample-offline-app-readme&utm_id=token-cta)

Once you have your token, paste it into the code here:

```ts
const API_KEY = '<API_KEY>';
```

This token is required for proper SDK registration and access to offline functionality 🎟️

### Getting Started
To launch the sample app locally:

```bash
bun install
cd ios && pod install && cd ..
bun start
```

Make sure you’ve replaced the API key before launching the app


## What else can the SDK do?

This sample focuses on core functionality – but the SDK offers much more:

* 🔐 DRM support (Widevine, FairPlay)
* ⏯️ Pause, resume, and cancel downloads
* 🎚️ Select video quality, audio tracks, and subtitles
* 📦 Manage multiple assets and download statuses
* 🎥 Seamless integration with `react-native-video`
